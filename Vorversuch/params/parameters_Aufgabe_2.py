Parameters required for "Aufgabe 2".

The only parameter required for the model of the mathematical pendulum of task 
2 is the length of the pendulum. We take this to be the distance l of the 
center of mass of the smartphone from the pivotal point of the pendulum. The 
value of l is given in SI units.
